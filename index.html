                <p>Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I don't
                    know what you
                    did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about
                    our mamas.</p>
                <p>Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Kids don't turn rotten just
                    from watching TV.
                    Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on
                    a killing spree.
                </p>
                <p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Ah, computer dating. It's like
                    pimping, but you
                    rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your
                    skin? You'd
                    think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</p>
                <p>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They
                    make you work, but
                    they don't pay you or let you go. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to
                    steal!</p>
                <p>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! No! The
                    kind with
                    looting and maybe starting a few fires! Tell them I hate them. So I really am important? How I feel
                    when I'm drunk
                    is correct?</p>
                <p>Bender, you risked your life to save me! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Take me to your leader!
                    Fry, we have a
                    crate to deliver. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and
                    spelling errors!</p>
                <p>How much did you make me? Tell them I hate them. I'm Santa Claus! Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
                    Fatal.</p>
                <p>Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with
                    all the bed making
                    you'll be doing. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people
                    won't be sure
                    you've done anything at all.</p>
                <p>Now what? Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what
                    would appear to be
                    some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…
                </p>
                <p>What are their names? Your best is an idiot! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor,
                    perhaps you can help
                    me with my sexual inhibitions? WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</p>
                <p>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Your best is an idiot! You'll have all the Slurm
                    you can drink when
                    you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! So, how 'bout them Knicks? Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite
                    loop, and he's
                    an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</p>
