                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                        Hello! I go by CND/Cindy/Cid and I'm a web developer and artist living in Denver with my pets in an apartment full of beautiful 
                    plants. I've been a freelance artist in all sorts of creative fields since earning my MFA from the School of the Museum 
                    of Fine Arts Boston in 2014. I've been making websites since I was 12, (over 20 years of experience with HTML and CSS 
                    thanks to the importance of having the coolest AIM profile a pre-teen could have).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                        In the past my web design skills were aquired out of necessity, back when the internet was a place of homepages and message boards. 
                    Every budding artist needed a portfolio website! Now my skills are a bit more sophisticated now. Coding (especially JavaScript) 
                    feels good and natural to my brain. There's always challenges and new things to learn, which could overwhelm some, but constant challenge 
                    and learning are where I thrive. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>    
                        I love to solve problems, make things work, and grow my knowledge and understanding with new projects and 
                    materials. Web dev offers endless learning and challenges that I'm ready to tackle. I love making slick UIs and have a strong understanding 
                    of design, an eye for color and contrast, and the drive to put it all togehter and make it work for the user. I also get a thrill out of databases 
                    and servers. Even when not on the design side I love solving problems and making things work, even when I want to rip my hair out in the 
                    middle of a problem. I'm tenacious and a little obsessive, but when it comes to coding that can be a huge boon.
